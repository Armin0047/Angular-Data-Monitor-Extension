# üß† Browser Extension for Monitoring Angular-Based Systems

I developed a modular browser extension that passively monitors and processes data within Angular-based web applications. Without disrupting system functionality, it captures key information and transmits it securely to a central API for analysis and reporting.

## üîß Key Features
- üéØ Listens to `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls at the client layer  
- üì¶ Extracts and structures data from server responses based on key fields  
- üïµÔ∏è Reads complementary data from the DOM (e.g., name, national ID, date, tracking code)  
- üß© Supports custom routes with dynamic parsing and smart data mapping  
- üöÄ Sends unified payloads to a central API for storage and analytics  

## üß± Architecture
Built with a modular design, the extension can be adapted to other platforms and monitoring needs. It‚Äôs lightweight, scalable, and designed for seamless integration with existing systems.

## ü§ù Collaboration
If you're working in:
- Process automation  
- Medical data analytics  
- Compliance or regulatory monitoring  

I'd be happy to share insights or explore collaboration opportunities.
