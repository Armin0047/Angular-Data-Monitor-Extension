# üß† Angular Data Monitor Extension

A modular browser extension designed to passively monitor and process data within Angular-based web applications. It operates without interfering with system functionality and securely transmits structured data to a central API for analysis and reporting.

## üîß Key Features
- üéØ Listens to `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls at the client layer  
- üì¶ Extracts and structures data from server responses based on key fields  
- üïµÔ∏è Reads complementary data from the DOM (e.g., name, national ID, date, tracking code)  
- üß© Supports custom routes with dynamic parsing and smart data mapping  
- üöÄ Sends unified payloads to a central API for storage and analytics
